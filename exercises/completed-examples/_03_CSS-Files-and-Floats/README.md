# Example Exercise

This exercise builds on the previous one, by modifying the about page to work with floats instead of inline-blocks, and using multiple CSS files instead of one.

The primary objective in this exercise is to understand:
1. How floats work and how they differ from blocks and inline-blocks
2. How to work with multiple .css files
